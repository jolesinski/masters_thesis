The point cloud segmentation or cluster extraction is the process of grouping together data points that meet some common condition of similarity. Ideally, each of such segmented clusters represents a different object in the scene. A popular segmentation method is based on the euclidean distance. In this approach, two points are considered to belong to the same cluster, if their relative distance is less than a selected threshold. This process is similar to the flood-fill algorithm, popular in the 2D image processing. There are also other varieties of segmentation, i.e. based on the smoothness constraint or colour similarity.

look for color-only descriptors
